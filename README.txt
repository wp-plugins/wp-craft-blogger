Add knitting and crochet crafting patterns to your blog with an easy-to-use interface.

== Description ==

WP Craft Blogger allows knitting and crochet bloggers to add patterns to their craft blog using
a simple interface and display them with a clean, standard layout.

Patterns are treated just like any other post, so they can be hidden behind a membership
requirement or password protected.

**Please note:** _This is a beta version of the plugin. Use of the plugin in its current state does mean
you may encounter bugs or lose settings on upgrade. You'll also get to guide the development with your
feature requests, so it's up to you! Support for extra crafts will be on the way just as soon as the initial
beta testing is complete._

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-craft-blogger` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Check out [the comprehensive Getting Started guide](http://codebyshellbot.com/knowledgebase/wp-craft-blogger/getting-started "Getting started with WP Craft Blogger").
4. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin include any Ravelry integration? =

Not right now. It's something I'm looking into as a possibility, for example being
able to automatically list fiber content of a particular yarn used in your pattern.

= Will you support X craft soon? =

Currently being worked on:

* Generic "other" craft (a generic tutorial layout)

If you'd like to request support for a specific craft with specific requirements, please
add ( or support an existing ) feature request in [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-craft-blogger "WP Craft Blogger support").
I'll see what I can do.

== Screenshots ==
